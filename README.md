# trying-to-be-a-mentor
in college i made alot of friends and some of them wanted to dive in the web development, so i offered them to join with me in a zoom meeting and i can explain to them what is HTML and CSS, how to use  them and some of the advanced things like using icons and i really did well, then i made this website in front of them and it felt so good. mentoring someone was actually a good experience. i love to share here.
and here's the [webbsite i made with them](https://teachingmyfriends.netlify.app/)
